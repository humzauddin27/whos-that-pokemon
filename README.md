This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Link to the game deployed to heroku: https://humzas-whos-that-pokemon.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple "Who's that Pokemon" guessing game, based on the guessing game that would happen between intermissions in the real television show.

Once you're on the site, a black figure of a pokemon should appear. This is the pokemon who you will have to guess using the input below the shadowed figure.

After one failed attempt, a hint will appear that shows the pokemon's type. After a second failed attempt, a second hint will appear showing the first letter of the pokemon's name. After three failed attemps, it simply shows the hidden pokemon, displaying some information about the pokemon.

And that's all there is to it! Have fun!
